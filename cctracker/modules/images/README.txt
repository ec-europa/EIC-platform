Reuse of /images/ directory of oppidoc git depot : https://{bitbucket-login}@bitbucket.org/ssire/oppistore.git oppistore
The case tracker reuses the oppistore code to upload and visualize user photos. 
This code is directly integrated inside the case tracker.

Eventually we could integrate it inside XCM if you decide to use XCM for upgraded case tracker 
(actually XCM is a shared library we started to use for Coach Match and for POD applications).
