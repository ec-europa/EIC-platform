      <legend>CoachCom2020 – The SME Instrument Community</legend>
      <p>CoachCom2020 is a coordination and support action (H2020-635518; 09/2014-08/2016) which has been selected by the European Commission to develop a framework for the business innovation coaching offered to the beneficiaries of the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument.</p>

        <li>EASME (the EC Agency responsible for the management of the SME Instrument initiative)</li>
        <li>Coaches (business innovation experts supporting the SME beneficiaries to achieve their innovation and commercialization objectives)</li>
        <li>KAMs (Key Account Managers working for the Enterprise Europe Network who act as a link between the SME beneficiaries and the coaches to facilitate and supervise the coaching process)</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>A holistic approach to business innovation along the stages of a company’s life cycle.</li>
        <li>A case tracking system facilitating the joint workflow of KAMs and coaches.</li>
        <li>An impact evaluation &amp; benchmarking system based on Key Performance Indicators.</li>
        <li>A learning platform for the professional community of business innovation coaches.</li>
      </ul>

      <legend>How to use CoachCom2020 Case Tracker beta ?</legend>
      <p>Configure your web browser to :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>accept cookies</li>
        <li>enable Javascript</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After a delay without any action (60') you will be disconnected from the server. In case you had left some windows opened and try to send some commands to the server through these windows you will get an error message telling you are not authorized to do so.</p>
      <p>The solution is to reload the page to get the identification prompt and to identify again. If this happens inside an editor window that you didn't save, do not reload that window but instead start a new session from a new window, then you will be able to save your content from the first legacy window. Anyway it is always best to save your content before leaving the computer or before switching to another activity.</p>
